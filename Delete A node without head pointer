Here Node pointer is the pointer which is to be deleted.
So what we will do is we will swap the curr node value with the next one until end..
and delete the last node.
void deleteNode(Node *node)
{
   Node* nextt;
   Node* prev;
   Node* curr=node;
   while(curr->next!=NULL)
   {
       prev=curr;
       nextt=curr->next;
       curr->data=nextt->data;
       curr=nextt;
   }
   prev->next=NULL;
}
